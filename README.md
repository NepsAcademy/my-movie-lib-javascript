# My Movie Library 🎬

Welcome to **My Movie Library with Javascript**\! This is the official example project for the [**Javascript Bootcamp V2 at Neps Academy**](link). The goal of this project is to apply new Javascript concepts into the previous [**project**](https://neps.academy/br/course/principios-basicos-do-desenvolvimento-web) to build a more beautiful, responsive, and interactive website.

This repository serves as a guide and a completed example for students of the course.
